# FileBasedBlog

current status:
post creation process:
can select multiple tags and select multiple categories 
multiple files can be selected but must be selected at once can't upload several times or removes previous uploads 
image can be uploaded and resized (automatic resizing not complete?) what is implemented now is locked aspect ratio and if image exceeds a certain value I will resize it to fit in my screen properly 
can choose either publish now or select schedule and select a time and day from the calendar (but still needs validation that time is not past)
other fields are also added title, description, content 

backend is not complete so I didn't upload it for now when there is some progress I will do 

photos of the UI exist in UIImages folder
