## Introduction to Web Development
Web development has evolved significantly, driven by advancements in tools, frameworks, and user expectations. Today, developers must create applications that are fast, responsive, accessible, and scalable. This post dives into the core components of modern web development, highlighting key technologies and practices to help you build user-friendly applications.

## Key Technologies
1. **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: The foundational trio of web development. HTML structures content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity. Modern standards like HTML5 and CSS3 enable rich multimedia and responsive designs.
2. **Frontend Frameworks**: Tools like React, Vue.js, and Angular simplify building dynamic user interfaces. For example, React's component-based architecture allows reusable UI elements, improving development efficiency.
3. **Backend Technologies**: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), and C# (ASP.NET Core) power server-side logic. These frameworks handle data processing, authentication, and API development.
4. **Databases**: SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) databases store application data. Choosing the right database depends on your app's scalability and data structure needs.
5. **APIs**: REST and GraphQL enable communication between frontend and backend. For instance, a REST API can handle form submissions, like the `multipart/form-data` used in profile updates.

## Best Practices for Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Start with a base stylesheet for smaller screens and use media queries to adjust for larger devices.
- **Flexible Layouts**: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility (a11y)**: Ensure your site is navigable via keyboard and screen readers. Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimize JavaScript bundles, lazy-load images, and leverage browser caching to improve load times.

## Building Scalable Applications
- **Microservices Architecture**: Break your application into smaller, independent services to improve scalability and maintainability.
- **API-First Design**: Develop APIs that are reusable and well-documented (e.g., using Swagger for ASP.NET Core APIs).
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling, like checking `HasFormContentType` in ASP.NET Core endpoints, prevents issues like the `415 Unsupported Media Type` error.
- **Security**: Implement JWT authentication (as seen in your `Authorization: Bearer` headers) and validate inputs to protect against attacks like XSS and CSRF.

## Example: Form Submission with FormData
Here's a practical example of handling form submissions, similar to the `change-name` endpoint you're working on:

```javascript
document.querySelector("#my-form").addEventListener("submit", async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const form = new FormData(e.target);
  try {
    const res = await fetch("/api/submit", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Authorization": `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem("authToken")}` },
      body: form
    });
    if (res.ok) {
      console.log("Success:", await res.json());
    } else {
      console.error("Error:", await res.text());
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Network error:", err);
  }
> });
```
